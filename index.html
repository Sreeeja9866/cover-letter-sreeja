          I'm writing to express my interest in the Junior Web Developer role at

          hands-on experience building responsive, secure, and scalable web

        <p>
          I'm a passionate and detail-oriented developer who enjoys turning
          complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. My journey in tech
          started with a love for logic and creativity, which led me to earn a

          full-stack projects using technologies like React, Node.js,
          PostgreSQL, and WordPress‚Äîalways striving to write clean, efficient,
          and maintainable code.

          Whether it‚Äôs building responsive user interfaces, developing secure
          APIs, or deploying cloud-based applications with Docker and AWS, I
          take pride in delivering reliable and polished solutions. I value
          collaboration and continuous learning, and I'm always looking for
          opportunities to grow both as a developer and a teammate.
